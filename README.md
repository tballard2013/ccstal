CCSTAL: "Creative Construction System for Templating All Llamas"

## Description

An approach to applying a branding template to content files.

## Motivation/Backstory

As a developer, I've always considered the branding, color scheme, even layout to be a "skin" to apply to the content which is the heart/value of any web project. This approach can decouple the various interests such as information architecture, topics, navigation, monetization, search engine optimization, metrics, etc. from being tightly intertwined. Until you've had to work in a project where these features are mashed together, and you are on a deadline and need to support, extend, or change the code in some other way, you really haven't lived. :-)  

This project is an effort to canonize the approach I tend to take in my own personal projects, and see if opening it up to others in this space might help elicit good ideas that other professional developers use.

I hope to avoid walled gardens and other vendor lock-in. (That's not to say these other approaches don't add value.)
