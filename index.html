        <h1>CCSTAL Example</h1>
        This page is an example of content. The idea is to keep the branding/skin separate from the content, avoiding mixing markup which conveys layout and visual presentation. Once upon a time (and maybe even today) search spiders were mostly concerned with the words in a web page and their links to other (hopefully related) content. 
        
        <p>All together they conveyed the informational value and did so without pollution from the visual look/feel aspects of the page. Ironically, that look/feel; the color scheme, type face, and information layout are all valued by the consumer, and indeed can contribute or detract from the process of absorbing and indexing the content by the actual human. But, those were pollution to search algorithms (...nerds, such smart monkeys).

        <p>Here's some more paragraphing. And another sentence for the factory. Factory lists are important too.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Here's a numbered item.</li>
            <li>Here's a numbered item.</li>
            <li>Here's a numbered item.</li>
            <li>Here's a numbered item.</li>
            <li>Here's a numbered item.</li>
            <li>Here's a numbered item.</li>
        </ol>

        <ul>
            <li>Here's an unnumbered item.</li>
            <li>Here's an unnumbered item.</li>
            <li>Here's an unnumbered item.</li>
            <li>Here's an unnumbered item.</li>
            <li>Here's an unnumbered item.</li>
            <li>Here's an unnumbered item.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Header Level Two</h2>

        Here's a paragraph associated with the header. And a sentence in the paragraph. Sentences are fun and important. 
        Well, usually, since in this case they are fodder intended really just to be sliced and diced for a template. 
        Though, I'll revisit these later to use better verbiage hopefully. For now, I'm just getting some words on the page. 
        The night was sultry.

        <h3>Header Level Three</h3>

        Here's a paragraph associated with the header. And a sentence in the paragraph. Sentences are fun and important. 
        Well, usually, since in this case they are fodder intended really just to be sliced and diced for a template.
